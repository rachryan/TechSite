## Copy Writing Principles Used

### Language Characteristics
- **Conversational**: Uses "you" and "we" throughout
- **Benefit-focused**: Every section answers "what's in it for me?"
- **Action-oriented**: Uses active verbs (discover, explore, connect)
- **Non-threatening**: "No pressure," "at your own pace," "no commitment"
- **Jargon-free**: Technical concepts explained in plain language

### Emotional Tone
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledges frustration ("feel overwhelmed")
- **Encouraging**: "You don't need to be technical"
- **Honest**: "No commitment—just possibilities"
- **Supportive**: "We'll show you," "We help you"

### Content Structure
- **Short paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Clear headings**: Benefit statements and questions
- **Scannable**: Emoji icons, numbered steps, bulleted benefits
- **Progressive**: Builds from awareness to consideration to action

### Call-to-Action Strategy
- **Low-pressure verbs**: Explore, Browse, Learn (not Buy, Sign Up, Subscribe)
- **Multiple options**: Always provide 2 choices to accommodate different comfort levels
- **Contextual**: CTAs relevant to the section content
- **Repeated**: Multiple opportunities throughout the page

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Plain language**: Reading level accessible to general audience
- **Clear structure**: Logical progression through content
- **Descriptive links**: "Learn more" includes context about destination
- **Alternative paths**: Multiple ways to take next steps
